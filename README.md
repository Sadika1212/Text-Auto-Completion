# Text-Auto-Completion
## Overview
This Streamlit app demonstrates text auto-completion using the LSTM model. Users can enter text and predict the next possible words based on the input text. This project utilizes the "Tweets Blogs News - Swiftkey Dataset 4million" dataset. This dataset includes a diverse collection of text data extracted from various sources such as tweets, blogs, and news articles. Only the blog data was used to train the model. The dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crmercado/tweets-blogs-news-swiftkey-dataset-4million.
